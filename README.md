***__This repository is archived! The cogs here may or may not work and serve as a example for new cog developers, I will be working towards porting my lib of cogs over to be compatable with Red V3 and working on Red's core as well. Once again, thanks for using my cogs.__***

Hi! Welcome to Refactored-Cogs. A collection of mostly moderator based cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot). Creating quality work since April 2016,

This GitHub is the main hub for code and documentation on these cogs. For support see the [wiki](https://github.com/Kowlin/refactored-cogs/wiki) or the [support server](https://kowlin.xyz/cogsupport)
